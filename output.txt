- Read post request to determine method and path
- We checked the parameter which was ingredient
- used curl to post our strings of ingredients by referencing our parameter ingredient in the curl request.

curl --data  "ingredient=1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper" localhost:4567/ingredients
